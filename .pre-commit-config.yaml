        description: >
          Commitizen fails when there are no new commits. To overcome this, we created
          tiny wrapper that verifies there are commits to check.

          Original description from Commitizen:
          Check all commit messages that are already on the current branch but not the
          default branch on the origin repository. Useful for checking messages after
          the fact (e.g., pre-push or in CI) without an expensive check of the entire
          repository history.
