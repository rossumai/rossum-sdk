## Development environment

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rossumai/rossum-sdk.git
```

Make sure that you have Python 3 installed. Version 3.10 or higher is required to run style checkers on pre-commit. On macOS, we recommend using `brew` to install Python.
For Windows, we recommend an official python.org release.

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
cd rossum-sdk

python -m venv .env

source .env/bin/activate
```

### Install `rossum-sdk` in editable mode

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Install coding style pre-commit hooks

This will make sure that your commits will have the correct coding style.

```bash
pre-commit install

pre-commit install-hooks
```

That's it. You should be ready to make changes, run tests, and make commits!

## Running tests
